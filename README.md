# Documentation
This is my personal brain dump of everything I'm learning and building around programming, blockchain, and machine learning. It's a mix of projects, experiments, notes, and ideas as I explore how code, smart systems, and decentralized tech all come together. Think of it as a growing journal of my journey through these fields â€” raw, practical, and always evolving.
